            As you may already know by the subtle hints located on the various pages, my name is Michael Adair. I am a Web Developer and I am very passionate about my work. The reason I love Web Development is because I get to automate processes, explore new avenues, and create something from only a computer and a vision. Being able to envision an idea for an application or service then making that vision come to life makes my work that much more meaningful.
            <br><br>
            Another benefit to being in the Computer Science field is being able to work with many people with different backgrounds. I have worked as a Freelance Web Developer for awhile now, in doing so I have met many people that have helped myself improve in my own field while also learning to appreciate other fields of work such as Graphic Design, Videography and Communication.
            <br><br>
            I personally believe in fate, the choices that we make eventually lead up to our predestined future. I am glad that I took the chance in taking the only "Web Development/Graphic Design" class that my Highschool offered. The one accomplishment that I am most proud of is becoming an Eagle Scout, it was not an easy task but I stuck through it and I would do it all over again if I had the choice.
